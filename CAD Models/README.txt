There are three folders containing different file types. The CAD-models that can be imported into Fusion360, the exported STL Files that are ready to be sliced and the sliced G-Code files. 

The G-Code files are ready to use with the settings used under the project. The last number in the file name pertains to percent infill. The 3D-print machines used are the Ultimaker 2 Extended+ series. They can also be printed on a normal Ultimaker 2+, except for the pendulums.
